<span class="dtstart published" title="2019-12-10T13:06:14Z"> 10 December 2019 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8136 "Archive: W3C Recommends CSS Writing Modes to support International writing modes")

[](https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-css-writing-modes-rec.html.en)The [CSS Working Group ](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) has published [CSS Writing Modes Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-css-writing-modes-3-20191210/) as a W3C Recommendation.



This CSS module defines CSS support for various international writing modes and their combinations, including left-to-right and right-to-left text ordering as well as horizontal and vertical orientations. These new CSS features allow a mixture of horizontal and vertical text regions on the same page. The specification also adds support for such things as isolation in bidirectional text, glyph orientation controls, and short, inline horizontal runs in lines of vertical text.

###<span class="expand_section">W3C Invites Implementations of the Sensor APIs</span>

<span class="dtstart published" title="2019-12-12T06:30:18Z"> 12 December 2019 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8164 "Archive: W3C Invites Implementations of the Sensor APIs")

[](https://www.w3.org/das/roadmap)
The [Devices and Sensors Working Group](https://www.w3.org/das/) invites implementations of four Candidate Recommendations:

* [Generic Sensor API](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-generic-sensor-20191212/) defines a framework for exposing sensor data to the Open Web Platform in a consistent way. It does so by defining a blueprint for writing specifications of concrete sensors along with an abstract Sensor interface that can be extended to accommodate different sensor types.
* [Accelerometer](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-accelerometer-20191212/) defines `Accelerometer`, `LinearAccelerationSensor` and `GravitySensor` interfaces for obtaining information about acceleration applied to the X, Y and Z axis of a device that hosts the sensor.
* [Gyroscope](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-gyroscope-20191212/) defines a concrete sensor interface to monitor the rate of rotation around the device’s local three primary axes.
* [Orientation Sensor](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-orientation-sensor-20191212/) defines a base orientation sensor interface and concrete sensor subclasses to monitor the device’s physical orientation in relation to a stationary three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.


Comments are welcome by **8 January 2020**.

###<span class="expand_section">W3C Invites Implementations of JSON-LD 1.1</span>

<span class="dtstart published" title="2019-12-12T06:26:11Z"> 12 December 2019 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8182 "Archive: W3C Invites Implementations of JSON-LD 1.1")


The [JSON-LD Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/) invites implementations of three Candidate Recommendations:

* [JSON-LD 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-json-ld11-20191212/) defines a JSON-based expression of Linked Data graphs. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It enables the creation of more easily interoperable Web services, the ability to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines, and brings more meaningful data to Web services and APIs.
* [JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-json-ld11-api-20191212/) defines an Application Programming Interface (API) for developers implementing a set of algorithms for programmatic transformations of JSON-LD documents.
* [JSON-LD 1.1 Framing](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-json-ld11-framing-20191212/) allows developers to query a JSON-LD document’s contained graph, by example, and reshape output into a specific JSON tree layout.


Candidate Recommendation means that the Working Group considers the technical design to be complete and is seeking implementation feedback on the documents. The group is keen to get comments and implementation experiences on these specifications as issues raised in the documents’ respective GitHub repositories (see the document headers for the exact references).



The group expects to satisfy the implementation goals (i.e., at least two, independent implementations for each of the test cases) by **17 February 2020**.

###<span class="expand_section">First Public Working Draft: Pointer Events Level 3</span>

<span class="dtstart published" title="2019-12-12T06:18:24Z"> 12 December 2019 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8194 "Archive: First Public Working Draft: Pointer Events Level 3")


The [Pointer Events Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/) has published a First Public Working Draft of [Pointer Events Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/WD-pointerevents3-20191212/). The features in this specification extend or modify those found in Pointer Events, a W3C Recommendation that describes events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices including a mouse, pen, touchscreen, etc. For compatibility with existing mouse based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire Mouse Events for other pointer device types.

###<span class="expand_section">W3C Recommends WebAssembly to push the limits for speed, efficiency and responsiveness</span>

<span class="dtstart published" title="2019-12-05T13:32:06Z"> 5 December 2019 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8123 "Archive: W3C Recommends WebAssembly to push the limits for speed, efficiency and responsiveness")

[](//www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en)
The [WebAssembly Working Group](//www.w3.org/wasm/) has published today the three WebAssembly specifications as W3C Recommendations, marking the arrival of a new language for the Web which allows code to run in the browser.
* [WebAssembly Core Specification](//www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-wasm-core-1-20191205/) defines a low-level virtual machine which closely mimicks the functionality of many microprocessors upon which it is run. Either through Just-In-Time compilation or interpretation, the WebAssembly engine can perform at nearly the speed of code compiled for a native platform. A *.wasm* resource is analogous to a Java *.class* file in that it contains static data and code segments which operate over that static data. Unlike Java, WebAssembly is typically produced as a compilation target from other programming languages like C/C++ and Rust.
* [WebAssembly Web API](//www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-wasm-web-api-1-20191205/) defines a Promise-based interface for requesting and executing a *.wasm* resource. The structure of a *.wasm* resource is optimized to allow execution to begin before the entire resource has been retrieved, which further enhances responsiveness of WebAssembly applications.
* [WebAssembly JavaScript Interface](//www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-wasm-js-api-1-20191205/) provides a JavaScript API for invoking and passing parameters to WebAssembly functions. In Web browsers, WebAssembly’s interactions with the host environment are all managed through JavaScript, which means that WebAssembly relies on JavaScript’s highly-engineered security model.

WebAssembly provides a safe, portable, low-level code format designed for efficient execution and compact representation. This technology enables the Web platform to perform more efficient execution of computationally-intensive algorithms, which in turn makes it practical to deliver whole new classes of user experience on the Web and elsewhere. Because WebAssembly is a platform-independent execution environment, it can also be used on any other computer platform. Please, read our [press release](//www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en) for additional information and acknowledgements.

###<span class="expand_section">W3C Invites Implementations of Publication Manifest and Audiobooks</span>

<span class="dtstart published" title="2019-12-05T06:57:27Z"> 5 December 2019 </span> | [Archive](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8113 "Archive: W3C Invites Implementations of Publication Manifest and Audiobooks")


The [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/) has just published a Candidate Recommendation for two documents, namely:

* [Publication Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-pub-manifest-20191205/) – This specification defines a general manifest format for expressing information about a digital publication. It uses [schema.org](http://schema.org) metadata augmented to include various structural properties about publications, serialized in JSON-LD, to enable interoperability between publishing formats while accommodating variances in the information that needs to be expressed.
* [Audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-audiobooks-20191205) – This specification describes the requirements for the creation of audiobooks, using a profile of the Publication Manifest specification.


The Group has also published an accompanying Working Group Note of [Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/NOTE-lpf-20191205/). This specification defines a file format and processing model for packaging into a single-file container the set of related resources and associated metadata that comprise a digital publication.



Candidate Recommendation means that the Working Group considers the technical design to be complete, and is seeking implementation feedback on the documents. The group is keen to get comments and implementation experiences on these specifications as issues raised in the the documents’ respective GitHub repositories (see the document headers for the exact references).



The group expects to satisfy the implementation goals (i.e., at least two, independent implementations for each of the test cases) by **31 March 2020**.
